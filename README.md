# TodoMVC using Embjer.js and Ember CLI

This is the TodoMVC app written while completing [Andy Brown's](https://github.com/brownie3003/) fantastic tutorial on getting started with Ember.js using Ember CLI.

The written tutorial is availabe here: http://thetechcofounder.com/getting-started-with-ember-js-using-ember-cli/

The tutorial was last updated in December of 2014, so for people digging into the tutorial now with the latest version of Ember CLI (0.2.2) and Ember.js (0.11), you may run into some issues with deprecated APIs among other things. This version has been rewritten to ensure that all deprecated APIs are using the latest supported version. I also added a couple of things that make the final product behave like the demos found at the [TodoMVC site](http://todomvc.com/examples/emberjs/), including a custom text input component that will focus when displayed.

Please see [Andy's original repo](https://github.com/brownie3003/ember-cli-todo-mvc) for additional details.
